## Importance Sampling

This repository contains materials for those interested in learning the basics of importance sampling. This algorithm is very powerful for simulating rare events and is a rather simple modification to [Monte Carlo sampling](https://github.com/natsan91/Monte_Carlo_in_Parallel). An interested reader is directed toward the [tutorial pdf](https://github.com/natsan91/Importance_Sampling/blob/master/Importance_Sampling_Tutorial.pdf) for the details on learning the basics of importance sampling. The Matlab files create some of the figures enclosed in the tutorial and hopefully provide additional information on how IS can be implemented.
